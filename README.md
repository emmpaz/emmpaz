# Hey, I'm Emmanuel Paz!

I recently graduated from Iowa State University studying Software Engineering with a minor in Spanish. This github will contain projects that either help me/others
or projects with a language I am interested in.


I am currently seeking a full-time position! In the mean time I am a free lance
Web Designer and Developer.

Check out some of my work:

[Paz Construction & Drywall, Inc](https://pazconstruction.co)

[Oasis Coffee Shop](https://oasiscoffeeshop.co)
